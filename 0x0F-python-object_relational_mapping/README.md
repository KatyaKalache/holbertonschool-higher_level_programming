# Python - Object-relational mapping
## Description
In this project, you will link to amazing worlds: Databases and Python!

In the first part, you will use the module `MySQLdb` to connect to a MySQL database and execute your SQL queries.

In the second part, you will use the module `SQLAlchemy` (don’t ask me how to pronounce it…) an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).
## Tasks:
0. Get all states
1. Filter states
2. Filter states by user input
3. SQL Injection
4. Cities by states
5. All cities by state
6. First state model
7. All states via SQLAlchemy
8. Write a script that prints the first State object from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa
9. Write a script that lists all State objects that contain the letter a from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa
10. Write a script that prints the State object with the name passed as argument from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa
11. Add a new state
Write a script that changes the name of a State object from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa
12. Write a script that changes the name of a State object from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa

Your script should take 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name
You must use the module SQLAlchemy
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
Change the name of the State where id = 2 to New Mexico
Your code should not be executed when imported
13. Write a script that deletes all State objects with a name containing the letter `a` from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa
14. Write a Python file similar to `model_state.py` named `model_city.py` that contains the class definition of a `City`.

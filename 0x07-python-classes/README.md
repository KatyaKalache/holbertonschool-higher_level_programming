## Tasks
0) Write an empty class `Square` that defines a square

1) Write a class `Square` that defines a square by: (based on 0))
Private instance attribute: `size`

2) Write a class `Square` that defines a square by: (based on 1))
Private instance attribute: `size`
Instantiation with optional size: `def __init__(self, size=0)`:

3) Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 2))
Private instance attribute: `size`. size must be an integer, otherwise raise a `TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer` 

4) Write a class `Square` that defines a square by: (based on 3)
property `def size(self)`: to retrieve it
property setter `def size(self, value)`: to set it

5) Write a class `Square` that defines a square by: (based on 4))
Private instance attribute: size:
property `def size(self)`: to retrieve it
property setter `def size(self, value)`: to set it

6) Write a class `Square` that defines a square by: (based on 5))
property `def size(self)`: to retrieve it
property setter `def size(self, value)`: to set it:

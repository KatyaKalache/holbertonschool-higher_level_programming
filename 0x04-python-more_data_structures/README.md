## Description
The project is part of Holberton school curriculum. It will help understand:

* What are set and how to use them
* What are the most common methods of set and how to use them
* When to use sets versus lists
* How to iterate into a set
* What are dictionary and how to use them
* When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
* What is a key in a dictionary
* How to iterate into a dictionary
* What is a lambda function
* What is map, reduce and map functions
## Compilation
chmod u+x __filename__
## Tasks:
0) Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix. 

1) Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.

2) Write a function that makes the addition of all unique integers in a list.

3) Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.

4) Write a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.
